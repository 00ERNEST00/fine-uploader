### Announcements ###
_September 18, 2012_ - I've created a [google doc spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AnQh9-ZBDuh_dEJGZFY1dEl2SDlGUGZNLUVfanZKeXc#gid=0)
where people can include ideas for Fine Uploader 3.0.  For some initial information about 3.0, have a look at the initial
ideas I have in the spreadsheet, along with [this discussion](#326).  Anyone can add ideas to
[the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AnQh9-ZBDuh_dEJGZFY1dEl2SDlGUGZNLUVfanZKeXc#gid=0).

### Summary ###

Welcome! This project attempts to achieve a user-friendly file-uploading experience over the web.
It's built as a Javascript plugin for developers looking to incorporate file-uploading into their website.

This plugin uses an XMLHttpRequest (AJAX) for uploading multiple files with a progress-bar in
FF3.6+, Safari4+, Chrome and falls back to hidden-iframe-based upload in other browsers (namely IE),
providing good user experience everywhere.

It does not use Flash, jQuery, or any external libraries.

Take a look at the new evolving [Demo](http://fineuploader.com) page.

Questions?  Comments?  Problems?  Post in the [forums](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/fineuploader).
