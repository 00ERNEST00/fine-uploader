# Getting Started with Fine Uploader {: .page-header }

This tutorial will serve as a step-by-step walkthrough for getting starting with
Fine Uploader. It is geared towards those who have minimal experience with
Javascript, server-side concepts, or the web.

The tutorial is not comprehensive or meant to cover all aspects of Fine Uploader.
For more information, make sure to read through the list of features as well
as the API documentation.

### 1. Download

You can get Fine Uploader in the [downloads](http://fineuploader.com/downloads.html)
section. The download comes bundled with all required scripts and modules.

### 2. Decide which Fine Uploader to use

#### Modes
Fine Uploader comes with two different modes pertaining to the user interface.

##### [Core Mode](../modes/core.html)
The most basic Fine Uploader mode.  Core mode assumes that the developer will code their own UI
but still make use of Fine Uploader's API. Core mode is suggested for advanced developers
who wish for to heavily customize the uploader's user interface. To use Core Mode:

```javascript
var uploader = new qq.FineUploaderBasic({/* options go here .... */});
```

##### [UI Mode](../modes/ui.html)
Inherits everything from Core mode. UI mode also comes with a fully functional
user interface which includes, but is not limited to: a default upload button,
progress bars, retry/cancel/delete buttons, proper display of error messages,
and more. UI mode is recommended for beginning developers or for those who
are pleased with the default Fine Uploader interface or can customize the default Fine Uploader
UI via CSS. To use UI Mode:

```javascript
var uploader = new qq.FineUploader({/* options go here ... */});
```

#### Endpoint Handlers

##### [Traditional](../endpoint_handlers/traditional.html)
To use the traditional endpoint handler, simply declare Fine Uploader as you
normally would.

##### [Amazon S3](../endpoint_handlers/amazon-s3.html)
Amazon's S3 is currently the most popular cloud service.
Fine Uploader comes with built in support that allows all files to be uploaded directly to S3 via the browser.
To make use of Fine Uploader S3:

```javascript
var uploader = new qq.s3.FineUploader({/* options go here ... */});
```

#### [jQuery](../integrating/jquery.html)

Fine Uploader is also easily used as a jQuery plugin. This plugin gives you
the ability to use either Core or UI mode.

To use Core Mode with the jQuery plugin simply set the uploaderType to be
'basic':

```javascript
$("#fine-uploader").fineUploader({uploaderType: 'basic' /* options go here... */});
```

To use UI Mode with the jQuery plugin:
```javascript
$("#fine-uploader").fineUploader({/* options go here... */});
```

To use Fine Uploader S3 with the jQuery plugin:
```javascript
$("#fine-uploader").fineUploaderS3({/* options go here... */});
```

### 3. Enabling Fine Uploader on your site

Its time to add the selected mode of Fine Uploader to your page:

{{ alert(
"""Henceforth this walkthrough will utilize the jQuery plugin of Fine Uploader.
This is because jQuery is more or less ubiquitous on the web, and its a safe bet
to assume it is included somewhere on your page. If you are forced to use the
non-jQuery version, then keep in mind that the syntax will be slightly different.""") }}

```html
<html>
  <head>
      <link href="fineuploader-{{ PKG['version']|e }}.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>
  </head>
  <body>

    <!-- The element where Fine Uploader will exist.
    ===== -->
    <div id="fine-uploader">
    </div>

    <!-- jQuery version 1.10.x (if you are using the jQuery plugin
    ===== -->
    <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

    <!-- Fine Uploader-jQuery
    ===== -->
    <script src="jquery.fineuploader-{{ PKG['version']|e }}.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

    <script>
    // Wait until the DOM is 'ready'
    $(document).ready(function () {
        $('#fineUploaderElementId').fineUploader({
            // The path to the server-side upload URI:
            request: {
                endpoint: '/uploads'
            }
        });
    });
    </script>

  </body>
</html>
```

When you load this page in a browser you should be able to see Fine Uploader's
default UI present. Uploading will not work yet. That will be tackled in an
upcoming section of this walkthrough.

[Next](02-setting_options.html), let's check out some of Fine Uploader's options.
