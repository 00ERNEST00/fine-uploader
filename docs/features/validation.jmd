# Validation {: .page-header }

Fine Uploader's validation abilities allow integrators to strictly define
what sorts of files can and can not be uploaded.

### `validation` option

{{ options_table(
    (
        ("acceptFiles", "comma-separated Strings", "`null`", "Used by the file selection dialog. Restrict the valid file types that appear in the selection dialog by listing valid content-type specifiers here. See docs on the [accept attribute of the `<input>` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-USHTML/Element/Input)"),
        ("allowedExtensions", "Array of Strings", "`[]`", "Specify file valid file extensions here to restrict uploads to specific types."),
        ("itemLimit", "`Number`", "`0`", "Maximum number of items that can be potentially uploaded in this session. Will reject all items that are added or retried after this limit is reached."),
        ("minSizeLimit", "`Number`", "`0`", "The minimum allowable size, in bytes, for an item."),
        ("sizeLimit", "`Number`", "`0`", "The maximum allowable size, in bytes, for an item."),
        ("stopOnFirstInvalidFile", "`Boolean`", "`true`", "When `true` the first invalid item will stop processing further files.")
    )
) }}

### `validation.image` option

{{ options_table(
    (
        ("maxHeight", "`Number`", "0", "Restrict images to a maximum height (wherever possible)."),
        ("maxWidth", "`Number`", "0", "Restrict images to a maximum width (wherever possible)."),
        ("minHeight", "`Number`", "0", "Restrict images to a minimum height (wherever possible)."),
        ("minWidth", "`Number`", "0", "Restrict images to a minimum width (wherever possible)."),
    )
) }}

## Events
{{ events_table(
    (
        ("validate", "`File` or `BlobData` fileOrBlobData", "Called once for each selection, dropped, or `addFiles`
        submitted file and for each `addBlobs` submitted `Blob`. You may return false to prevent the file from being
        submitted.  You may also return a [`qq.Promise`](async-tasks-and-promises.html)." ),
        ("validateBatch", "`Array` fileOrBlobDataArray", "Called once for each batch of selected, dropped or `addFiles`
        submitted files and for each `addBlobs` submitted `Blob`s. You may return false to prevent all files in the
        batch from being submitted.  You may also return a [`qq.Promise`](async-tasks-and-promises.html)."),
    )
) }}

The `validate` and `validateBatch` events are thrown/called before the default
Fine Uploader validators (defined in the options) execute.

If the `validation.stopOnFirstInvalidFile` option is enabled, then neither of
these events will be thrown preceding a file being invalid (i.e., one of these
callbacks returned `false`).

Also note that a `BlobData` object has two properties:

```javascript
{
    name: "", /* The name of the file or blob */
    size: "", /* the size of the file or blob */
}
```

## Validation on File Name

Until Fine Uploader is able to detect file mimetype client-side, validation
on name is the best way to ensure that only the correct sorts of files get
uploaded to your server.

Validation on name can be controlled by modifying the `validation` settings,
as documented above. The most important options are: `allowedExtensions` and
`acceptFiles`.

## Validation on File Size

Size validation is available in File API browsers only. Size can be restricted
via the `sizeLimit` or `minSizeLimit` options in the `validation` settings.

## Image Validation

As of 4.1, the ability to restrict submitted images based on width and height is possible.  See the `validation.image`
option for specifics.  Keep in mind that this feature was created with processed images in mind, and not images
sent directly from a camera.  Some browsers may natively report width and height swapped for JPEGs (from cameras) based
on the orientation of the camera.  Those uploading pictures directly from cameras have no control over the
dimensions of the image, so it doesn't seem to make much sense to impose these restrictions if you expect your users
to upload images directly via a camera.  In that case, it likely makes more sense to allow the user to scale the image
first (before submitting the file) or simply impose a file size restriction.

Also, this feature is dependant on the preview generation feature, and therefore is only supported in modern browsers.
Check the browser support matrix or the `qq.supportedFeatures.imageValidation` flag for more specific information.
If image dimension validation is important to your application, you will also need a server-side fallback to account
for older browsers and TIFFs (if allowed, since TIFFs are only previewable in Safari).
