# Options <small>S3</small> {: .page-header }

If you are using the S3 uploader, many of Fine Uploader's options mean the same
as if you were using the Traditional uploader. However, some of the options are
slightly different. This page will list any new or different options for the S3
uploader. Any option not listed here can be assumed to have the same behavior
for the Traditonal or S3 uploader.

### `request` option

{{ options_table(
    (
        ("endpoint", "`String`", "`'/server/upload'`", "The fully qualified URL for the S3 bucket."),
